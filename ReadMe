# CogniCare: Cognitive Health Management Platform

CogniCare is a web based platform for providers, patients, and caregivers to manage cognitive health. The site offers dashboards for each user type, cognitive games (puzzle, color matching, pairs) with multiple difficulty levels, daily checklists, memory questionnaires, and a test mode for providers to demonstrate games and assessments without saving results. Providers can assign tasks, track results, and manage users, all within a modern, emoji enhanced interface designed for engagement and clarity.
